        <p>I’m a molecular biologist living in Germany, originally from the U.S., wrapping up my PhD. My current research focuses on gene expression in complex microbial systems, including diatoms, fungi, and bacteria. I’ve always been fascinated by how organisms interact at the molecular level, especially during parasitism and symbiosis.</p>

        <p>Before diving into genomics, I earned a Master’s in horticultural microbiology in Sweden, and prior to that, completed a Bachelor’s degree at West Point. I spent five years as a U.S. Army officer, including a deployment to Afghanistan. Later, I pursued a PhD in Geochemistry with a focus on supervolcanoes and mineral deposits before switching gears toward molecular ecology. Life’s had its tough turns—international moves, a divorce—but also incredible highs: remarriage, three wonderful kids (and a fourth on the way), and a research career that feels deeply meaningful.</p>

        <p>Someday, I’d like to write a book that connects these life experiences—military, science, resilience, and curiosity—into something readable and real. For now, I’m focused on building a postdoc around fungal life cycles and their influence on transcription and ecology.</p>

      <h2>Current Work</h2>
      <p>My research explores how fungal parasites of diatoms influence gene expression, metabolism, and nutrient flow in freshwater ecosystems. I combine transcriptomics, cell counts, SIMS (for single-cell nutrient uptake), and chemical analyses to understand how infections reshape the host and its microbial community.</p>

      <p>Using a new Asterionella genome and 30 co-occurring bacterial MAGs, I investigate how infection stages affect transcription in the host and its microbiome. Late-stage infections show host upregulation in fatty acid and photosynthesis pathways, alongside increased bacterial expression of nutrient degradation and vitamin transport genes. These patterns suggest fungi remodel host metabolism in ways that facilitate bacterial access to resources.</p>
